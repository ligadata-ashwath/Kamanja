Cluster (Kamanja)

In a Kamanja environment,
a cluster is a group of one or more Kamanja :ref:`nodes<node-term>`
that work together on the same task;
typically, clusters do not overlap.

For more information:

- The :ref:`clusterconfig-config-ref` file contains
  configuration for all clusters in the environment.
- Use the :ref:`clusterinstallerdriver-command-ref` command
  to install a cluster.
