Introduction
============

LigaData has released a set of three videos that show
the training of a simple model, capturing the model by producing PMML,
then using the PMML to execute that model in the full Kamanja system.
This is interesting because it shows a production situation
and shows the entire suite deployed.
Some manual running of the Kamanja components is required,
which makes it better for understanding Kamanja.

This video is presented in three parts,
with each part roughly 20 minutes long.
The three parts of this video achieve the following results: produce PMML;
use it to score the data through R;
then score the data through Kamanja and compare the results.

- `Part 1 <https://youtu.be/-ovyP9IoxhU>`_ shows
  how to produce the PMML using the Rattle tool,
  as a friendly user interface to the R language,
  and uses statements in the R language to make the data more user-friendly.

- `Part 2 <https://youtu.be/-ovyP9IoxhU>`_ shows how to prepare this data
  and the files needed for processing it in Kamanja.

- `Part 3 <https://youtu.be/xcGcBV-qxag>`_ shows wedding the data
  not Kamanja and producing scores.
