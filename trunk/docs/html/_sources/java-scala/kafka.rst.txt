Creating Kafka topics
=====================

First, create the Kafka topics by running the following command:

::

  > kamanja create queues

Expected output:

::

  Created topic "testin_1".
  Created topic "testout_1".
  Created topic "teststatus_1".

Note: These names are currently hard-coded for the sample applications
that Kamanja provides.
These default names are only for the sample applications.

There may be errors that the topics have already been created.
Just ignore and proceed with the next instructions.
