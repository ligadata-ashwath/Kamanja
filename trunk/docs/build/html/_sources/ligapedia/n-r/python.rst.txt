Python
------

Python is one of the most popular programming languages
for rapid prototyping in the data science community.
The Python language provides a rich set of statistical libraries
(written in C/C++ languages).
Some libraries include, but are not limited to,
the Numpy math module,
TensorFlow,
and scikit-learn.
Kamanja Python support allows the user to plug an existing Python model
into the Kamanja cluster.
If an organization has Python developers
and a significant investment in Python-based applications,
but without the infrastructure to connect its systems to near real-time feeds,
running these applications on Kamanja
tremendously increases the value of these applications.
