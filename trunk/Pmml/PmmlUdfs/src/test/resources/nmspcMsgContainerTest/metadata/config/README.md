The MetadataAPI and KamanjaManager both have config files at this moment that must have the same values for metadata location.
This will not be required in a future release, but for now, you can use these two to see where values have to be the same.
COPD.cfg is for the KamanjaManager and the MetadataAPIConfig.json is for MetadataAPI execution.
